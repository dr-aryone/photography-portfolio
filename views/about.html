        <p id="about-text">Hello, my name is Jack Fisher and I am a 24 year old photographer from Edinburgh. Photography has been my
            hobby for roughly 3 years, mainly shooting around Edinburgh and whilst on holiday. I like to shoot
            both digital and film and experiment with various styles. Recently I've been using an Olympus XA-2 and an
            Olympus OM-1 for all of my film photography. If you are interested in seeing more of my photos you can find
            me on Instagram.</p>
